                <p>When I moved to the UK as a grad student, navigating the landscape of a new culture,
                    I found belonging in libraries &mdash; spaces where access felt like a human right, not a privilege &mdash;
                    universal and equitable.</p>
                
                <p>During my time at the <a href="https://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>, I organised a roundtable on
                    <a href="https://theodi.org/insights/reports/improving-data-and-information-access-in-regulated-sectors-report/">
                        improving data access across regulated sectors</a>. Working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierthereaux/">Olivier</a> and <a href="https://theodi.org/profile/josh-daddario/">Josh</a>, we brought together technology leaders from banking, insurance,
                    accountancy, law, and government. What emerged vividly was the profound trust participants placed in
                    intermediaries. Leaders shared an openness grounded in respect for the integrity and neutrality of these
                    trusted bridges. Intermediaries facilitated genuine exchanges without the weight of competition or guarded
                    interests, enabling secure and valuable information flows that supported a more open, trustworthy, and
                    sustainable data ecosystem.</p>
                
                <p>Seeing competitors unite around shared values highlights that intermediaries are more
                    than mere connectors; they are custodians of continuity, fostering collaboration across complex systems.
                    Like roots in a forest, intermediaries support the flow of knowledge and resources, making systems more
                    connected and resilient.</p>
                
                <p>Reflecting on the future of digital transformation, my journey &mdash; from working
                    on data trusts to feeling a sense of belonging &mdash; has drawn me towards foundational principles of
                    radical acceptance and universality. Intermediaries have a crucial role in nurturing and sustaining
                    inclusive spaces where everyone belongs.</p>
                
                <p>As we shape the discussions on the future of digital public service, perhaps the most
                    meaningful answers lie in the questions we&rsquo;re encouraged to ask:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Could our vision hold space for universality, providing a foundation upon which all
                        can build and belong?</li>
                    <li>Could we be bold enough to bring equitable outcomes as the highest measure of success
                        while designing these services?</li>
                </ul>
